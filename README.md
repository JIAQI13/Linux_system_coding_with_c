Group: Muhammad Usman, Jiaqi Liu (usman1, jiaqi11)

Work balance: Almost every line of code was done through peer programming in person.
We worked together to set up the assignment on March 8 at 11:00 AM for 3 hours.
We spent about 7 hours on both March 13 and March 14 together in CSC doing both server and client.
Communication was initially through uAlberta email and then through Discord.

The code was tested and running through SSH on our laptops.
